# UI5 Web Components Data Binding Example

The repository contains a sample application that uses the UI5 Web Components in a very lightweight and performant way. Additionally, the application shows how to implement data binding with UI5 Web Components, which is a feature that is usually only available when using the more heavyweight UI5 framework. This showcases the power, flexibility, compatibility and ease of use of the UI5 Web Components.
